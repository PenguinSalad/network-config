# network-config
College project where I implement several functions that help manage the network config.

I will develop a small application that is capable of modifying part of the network configuration of the local machine, only in what has to do with the domain name resolution, for an adapter to be determined between those of a list of dns servers written to a text file, in case the server current dns is not the fastest among those provided.
